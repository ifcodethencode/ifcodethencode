          👋 Hi, I’m @ifcodethencode
    👀 I’m interested in computer science (code) and logistics/business.
🌱 I’m currently learning two languages and im still not sure if im learning the right ones, but i have to start somewhere! Learning C and Javascript. Did a month of HTML and a few weeks of css until a programmer friend of mine told me those arent real languages!
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and doing anything to further my knowledge because i need all the help i can get!
📫 How to reach me  Email is tylerwolford123@gmail.com.
   i have a few app and webpage ideas so if youre interested, let me know!

           HAVE A GREAT DAY!
              GOD BLESS
